Overview
========

This is an *open source version* of the Everpix Unarchiver app for Mac provided by Everpix as part of the service shutdown in November 2013. The app can be used to recreate JPEG files with metadata like EXIF from the contents of an Everpix photo collection archive. It requires OS X 10.7 or later.

For more information about Everpix photo collection archives or to download the *official* Everpix Unarchiver app for Mac, please see http://www.everpix.com/archives.html.

**IMPORTANT: Contrary to the official version which uses the Everpix proprietary high-fidelity image pipeline, due to IP restrictions, this open source version uses the built-in JPEG 2000 support in OS X (through CoreGraphics) to convert JPEG 2000 images to JPEG ones. It is therefore recommended you use the official app with your Everpix photo collection archive to ensure maximum photo quality.**
